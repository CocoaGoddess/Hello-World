# Hello-World

Just another repository
My name is Trina Covington. I have two children, Ashley 31 and Andre 24. I have one grandson and another grandbaby on the way in August. This experince is entirely new to me but here I am. I started at Amazon CHA1 in 2014, then coverted in 2015 as a packer. I decided it's time to take advange of the training with hopes of moving to another department or finding a job in this field.
